# Privacy Policy for the "Weather Please" Browser Extension

_Last updated: August 29, 2023_

Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy outlines the personal data the "Weather Please" browser extension may collect and how that data is used.

## 1. Information We Don't Collect

"Weather Please" does **not** collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data related to your browsing activity. We do not access, retain, or share personal data such as IP addresses, geolocation data, or browsing history.

## 2. Anonymised Crash Data and Error Reporting

To improve the functionality and user experience of our browser extension, we offer users the option to opt-in to sending anonymised crash data and error reports. This data is solely used for the purpose of identifying and fixing bugs or issues within the extension. It does not contain any personal information and cannot be traced back to individual users.

If you wish to opt-in to this feature, you can do so in the extension settings. You have the full discretion to enable or disable this feature at any time.

## 3. Third-party Data Use

To retrieve localized weather information, users may choose to provide either their IP information or their latitude/longitude to third-party services. These third-party services operate under their own privacy policies, and "Weather Please" does not have control over their data collection and usage practices. You can access third-party service privacy policies here:

## 4. How We Use Your Information

Apart from the anonymised crash data and error reports which you can opt-in to share with us, we don't collect any other personal data. As such, we do not and cannot use or share it in any way.

## 5. Your Choices

You have the ability to choose whether to use our browser extension, to provide your IP or geolocation data to the third-party weather services, and to opt-in to sending us anonymised crash data and error reports. If you do not agree with these terms, you should cease use of the "Weather Please" browser extension.

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted.
